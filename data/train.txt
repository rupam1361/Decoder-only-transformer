Pip landed on the branch and said, "What is this bitter fruit?" A wise old owl was sitting on another branch nearby and heard Pip's question. The owl said, "That's a persimmon fruit. It's very bitter, but some people like it. Would you like me to explain more about it?" Pip nodded his head and the owl continued, "Persimmons are fruits that grow on trees. They are orange and round, but they taste very bitter until they are ripe. Then they become sweet and delicious to eat."
